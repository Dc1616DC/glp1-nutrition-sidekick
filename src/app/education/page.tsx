    title: 'Why Protein Matters on GLP-1 Medications',
    description:
      'Learn how prioritizing protein can help you preserve muscle mass and feel fuller longer while on your weight loss journey.',

      <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700">
        <p>
          GLP-1 medications like OzempicÂ® or WegovyÂ® are incredibly effective for
          weight loss, primarily by reducing your appetite. However, when you
          eat less, it's crucial to make every calorie count. This is where
          protein becomes your most valuable player.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-800">
          The Two Main Benefits of Prioritizing Protein:
        </h3>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li>
            <strong>Preserving Muscle Mass:</strong> When you lose weight, you
            don't just lose fat; you can lose muscle too. Losing muscle can slow
            down your metabolism, making it harder to keep the weight off long-term.
            Eating enough protein provides the building blocks your body needs to
            maintain lean muscle while primarily burning fat for energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Increasing Satiety (Fullness):</strong> Protein is the most
            satiating macronutrient. This means it helps you feel fuller for
            longer compared to fats or carbohydrates. This is a powerful advantage
            when you're already experiencing reduced appetite from your medication,
            as it helps prevent cravings and ensures you feel satisfied with smaller
            portions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Our recommendation is to aim for <strong>25-35 grams of protein</strong> per meal.
          This simple strategy can significantly improve the quality of your weight
          loss, helping you achieve more sustainable and healthier results.
